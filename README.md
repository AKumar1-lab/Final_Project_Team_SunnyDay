## Final_Project_Team_SunnyDay

Final Project - First Segment: Sketch It Out

##### Team Members: Jake Zebker, Kellen Schmitz, Chung In "Angel" Ngan, Angela Kumar

##### Selected topic: 

Analysis of solar energy potential for a given location (in US) to save on electricity and does one qualify based on the number of sunny days that your state incurs

### Purpose

Climate change is real, and renewable energy such as solar power is becoming the choice to save on electricity costs.

### Overview

Machine Learning: to predict the actual sunny days, when including weather, for a given location â€“ then calculate the theoretic breakeven of investment in a rooftop solar system.

Visualization:  Mapping the number of sunny days that a location receives on average. Graph of solar potential over a year (showing seasonal variability) for the location. 
Graph of historical average electricity price for given area. Etc.

Story telling: Mapbox/JS/Plotly or Tableau story board 

### Description of their source of data 

Resources:

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/

https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar-supply-curves.html

https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/ = There is an API for some weather data, based on longitude and latitude

Additional likely sources include: WeatherData, Department of Energy, NOAA.gov, NASA, trade groups

Technologies:  Python, JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, Google Colaboratory, Google Sheets, Google Slides.


### Questions they hope to answer with the data

When including variables beyond solar potential (such as regional weather, climate change, electricity prices) does it make financial sense to install rooftop solar? 
If so, what is the breakeven point and how much will you save on electricity costs once solar is installed?
