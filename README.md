#### Selected topic: 

Global Horizontal Irradiance measures the brightness of the sun in a given location around the globe.  However for the purpose of this project, we have focused only on the Contiguous United States(excluding Alaska and Hawaii).

Analysis of solar energy potential based on the zip code in the Contiguous United States has the potential cost savings on electricity and the machine learning prediction does zip code qualify based on the number of sunny days or global horizontal irradiance(GHI) in that location, if so, how much will be the system installation and how many years will it take to breakeven.

#### Purpose or Why the topic was selected :

Climate change is real, and renewable energy such as solar power is becoming the choice to save on electricity costs.
The topic was selected due many factors: 

 * Climate change and global warming
 * Power outages, wildfires, and other natural disasters 
 * Increased greenhouse gas emissions
 * Increased interest in renewable energy specifically rooftop solar and energy storage.
 * Cost savings on electric

#### Overview

Machine Learning: When including variables such as zip code, latitude and longitude does the global horizontal irradiance predict accurately for the zip code entered?

Visualization:  Mapping the number of sunny days that a location receives on average. Graph of solar potential over a year (showing seasonal variability) for the location. 
Graph of historical average electricity price for given area. Etc.

Story telling: Mapbox/JS/Plotly or Tableau story board

#### Questions we hope to answer with the data

When the user enters variables such as zip code and current electric bill does the global horizontal irradiance predict accurately for the zip code entered?

Based on the zip code,average electric rates the state incurs per kwh along with average cost of the the solar system installation, how many years does it take to breakeven on the cost?

#### GitHub



#### Machine Learning Model

#### Database Integration

#### Dashboard



#### First Segment: Sketch It Out 
Selection of a topic

Discussion on datasets, data visualization, and technologies.


#### Second Segment: Build the Pieces

Refined the topic further based on dataset found and interest
Github with branches created for each members, but also referencing their own repository for prospective career opportunities.
Google slide presentation shared among all collaborators
Machine Learning component has been been completed, will need to refine and embed into presentation and tableau or github pages.
Data visualization still to complete with additional graphs , we have a partial storyboard.

#### Third Segment - Plug It In
