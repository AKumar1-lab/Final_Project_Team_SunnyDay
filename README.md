## Final_Project_Team_SunnyDay

* Final Project - Second Segment: Build the Pieces

Refined the topic further based on dataset found and interest
Github with branches created for each members, but also referencing their own repository for prospective career opportunities.
Google slide presentation shared among all collaborators
Machine Learning component has been been completed, will need to refine and embed into presentation and tableau or github pages.
Data visualization still to complete with additional graphs , we have a partial storyboard.

* Final Project - First Segment: Sketch It Out 
Selected a topic
Discussion on datasets, data visualization, and technologies.

##### Selected topic: 

Analysis of solar energy potential for a given location (in US) to save on electricity and does one qualify based on the number of sunny days or global horizontal irradiance(GHI) that your state incurs.  

Global Horizontal Irradiance measures the brightness of the sun in a given location around the globe.  However for the purpose of this project, we have focused only on the United States.

### Purpose

Climate change is real, and renewable energy such as solar power is becoming the choice to save on electricity costs.
The topic was selected due many factors: 

 * Climate change and global warming
 * Power outages, wildfires, and other natural disasters 
 * Increased greenhouse gas emissions
 * Increased interest in renewable energy specifically rooftop solar and energy storage.
 * Cost savings on electric


### Overview

Machine Learning: When including variables such as zip code, latitude and longitude does the global horizontal irradiance predict accurately for the zip code entered?

Does the zip code entered fall into a bright zone or dark zone? Meaning farther from the sun, or in a location that has extreme weather? (i.e. rain, snow, fog, or other vulnerabilities)

Visualization:  Mapping the number of sunny days that a location receives on average. Graph of solar potential over a year (showing seasonal variability) for the location. 
Graph of historical average electricity price for given area. Etc.

Story telling: Mapbox/JS/Plotly or Tableau story board

### Questions they hope to answer with the data

When including variables such as zip code, latitude and longitude does the global horizontal irradiance predict accurately for the zip code entered?

Does the zip code entered fall into a bright zone or dark zone? Meaning farther from the sun, or in a location that has extreme weather? (i.e. rain, snow, fog, or other vulnerabilities)
