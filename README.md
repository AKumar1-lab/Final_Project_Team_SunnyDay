Final Project - First Segment: Sketch It Out

Team Members: Jake Zebker, Kellen Schmitz, Chung In "Angel" Ngan, Angela Kumar

### Selected topic: Solar energy to save on electricity and does one qualify based on the number of sunny days that your state incurs


### Purpose

Climate change is real, and renewable energy such as solar power is becoming the choice to save on electricity costs.

### Overview

Machine Learning: to predict the if one qualifies for solar based on the number of sunny days a state/location gets. 

Visualization:  Mapping the number of sunny days that a state receives on average.

Story telling: Tableau story board 


### Description of their source of data 

Resources:

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/

https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar-supply-curves.html

https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/ = There is an API for some weather data, based on longitude and latitude

Most likely other sources such as WeatherData

Technologies:  Python, JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, Google Colaboratory, Google Sheets, Google Slides.


### Questions they hope to answer with the data

Do you qualify for solar power in your state based on the number of sunny days?
How much will you save on electricity costs once solar is installed?
